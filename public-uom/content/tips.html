<h2 class="dbs">General Facilitator's Tips:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Be consistent to ask the questions as the process itself encourages
    reproducibility (how you model your HOP is how your participants will model
    their new HOP)</li>
  <li>Ask someone to share a section of the Three-thirds process each week to
    train them eventually to facilitate their own HOP (*Each participant can be
    encouraged to start a new HOP with persons of peace within their own social
    circles).</li>
  <li>You can start with one other person to start a HOP!</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="dbs">LOOK BACK:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to ask how people how they applied the lesson and to whom did they
    share (it is important to be modelling these as a facilitator)</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="dbs">LOOK UP:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this section ensure you direct people to the passage so that the answers
    come from the text/story (that highlight who Jesus/God is,/what He does,
    people's response, and how this will change our response to Jesus/God..</li>
  <li>We want to highlight what specifically</li>
  <li>If they answer something that doesnâ€™t directly come from the passage, ask
    where they observed this from the text. You can rephrase</li>
  <li>Call upon people in the group to share if there is prolonged silence...and
    also so everyone has a chance to share/participate.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="dbs">LOOK FORWARD:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>These questions help us put into practice what we learnt about Christ, and
    how He wants us to change/act/obey.</li>
  <li>We want people to intentionally care for and look for opportunities to
    share Christ: *includes praying for/or with people with a specific need or
    meeting a need; sharing the story; the gospel or their personal stories of
    how Jesus has been at work in their life.</li>
</ul>
