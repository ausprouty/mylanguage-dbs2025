      Design your own journey. Faith is meant to be lived out in community.
      Here is an outline that you can follow with any Bible passage once you
      have completed Journey One.

    <h3 class="dbs">LOOK BACK</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>How have you experienced God this week?</li>
      <li>What are you thankful for?</li>
      <li>What do you need God’s help for?</li>
      <li>How can we help you with your needs?</li>
      <li>Pray for each other</li>
      <li>What have you put into practice since our last meeting?</li>
      <li>How are the people that you are caring for going? What would help them most?</li>
      <li>Were you able to share a God experience with anyone? Did you pray with them?</li>
      <li>Pray for these people</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="dbs">LOOK UP</h3>

    <ol  start="10">

      <li>Was there anything missed or added?</li>

          <li>A promise to claim?</li>
          <li>An example to follow?</li>
          <li>A command to obey?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Share this with the group</li>
      <li>Who will you share today’s lesson with?</li>
      <li>When do you want to meet again?</li>
