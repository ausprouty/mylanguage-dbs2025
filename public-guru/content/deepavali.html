<h1 class="dbs">Deepavali and the Light of Lord Jesus</h1>

<p>
  The festival of Deepavali is a beautiful celebration of light overcoming
  darkness and good triumphing over what troubles the soul. It is a time of joy,
  reflection, and hope.
</p>

<p>Deepavali reminds me of the words of Lord Jesus:</p>

<blockquote>
  “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but
  will have the light of life.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  Just as the Deepavali lamps symbolize the victory of light, they also remind
  us of how Lord Jesus' perfect life and selfless sacrifice can free us
  from the inner darkness that weighs on our hearts.
</p>

<blockquote>
  “In him was life, and that life was the light of all people. The light shines
  in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  As we look forward to the end of Kalyug, we also await the return of Lord Shri
  Jesus, who will bring everlasting light to this world.
</p>

<p>
  Today, you too can experience freedom from your burdens through the light of
  Lord Jesus Christ. He invites us, saying:
</p>

<blockquote>
  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
  Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart,
  and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is
  light.”
</blockquote>

<p>
  Lord Jesus is coming again to dispel the darkness of Kalyug and bring
  lasting peace. May Lord Jesus, through His divine light, fill your life
  with hope, peace, and joy this Deepavali.
</p>

<h2 class="dbs">On this occasion of Deepavali, you can pray…</h2>

<blockquote>
  Lord Jesus, I bow my head at your feet. You have said that if I seek you
  with all my heart, I will surely find you. Lord Jesus, you are the
  supreme light—let your divine light shine within me, lifting every burden and
  freeing me from the darkness that troubles my soul. Fill my heart with your
  presence and guide me in your way of peace. Reveal yourself to me, that I may
  walk in your light and rest in your love.
